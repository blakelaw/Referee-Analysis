## Description

This project investigates the neutrality of referees in approximately 64,000 NBA games. The investigation leveraged several tools and approaches including Python (pandas), SQL, R, and Tableau. Here are the highlights of the project:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilized pandas and SQL for preprocessing the public dataset encompassing a substantial number of NBA games.
  
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Developed three distinct quantitative approaches to evaluate the impact of referees on game metrics and results. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was a key tool in this phase.

- **Visualization**: Presented the findings using visualizations created in Tableau and Datawrapper, offering a clear representation of the analyzed data.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied gradient boosting methods to assess the importance of various features. Furthermore, instrumental variable analysis and propensity score matching were employed to gauge potential causality.
  
- **Results**: The analysis did not find any evidence pointing towards a systemic bias on the part of the referees.

Feel free to explore the code and the methodologies applied during this investigation.
